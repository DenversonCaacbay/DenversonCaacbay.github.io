                    <h1>While we are waiting for the company, he asked us to do a CRUD in C# this time. Simple UI is okay since we are focused 
                        on the functionalities. It took us a week since we are still figuring things out on it. After we finished the simple project, 
                        we showed it to him and said that it was good. He then told us we are ready for the main project.</h1>

              <h1>At this point, the company told us the system that he want to have and devices that will be used in the system. 
                  We then started the project while waiting for the devices so that it have progress. The project took us weeks since 
                  there's some hard functionalities that is needed in the project and we took breaks for us to not be burnout. 
                  We showed them the progress of the project so that they are aware. After we finished the project, we showed the final 
                  system to them. It was good but it needs some polishing. We didn't do the devices since it was complicated for us
                   to do and they said it was okay. It was a fun experience to work with them.</h1>
